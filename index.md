I'm a philosopher interested in interdisciplinary approaches to emotions, particularly in the frontier between philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.

I recently defended my doctoral dissertation at the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/) and the [Institut für Philosophie](https://www.philosophie.hu-berlin.de/) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. In my dissertation I examined some challenges that scientific theories of emotions face and that threaten the elimination of emotions from our scientific vocabulary. I argued that in order to meet these challenges, we must take a step back and examine our folk emotional vocabulary in order to 'reconstitute' the phenomena, and then make clear on what grounds can a scientific theory of emotions construct projectible categories that capture emotion kinds. The dissertation was qualified _summa cum laude_ and is pending publication. 

In the meantime I am an adjunct lecturer at the [Escuela de Ciencias Humanas](http://www.urosario.edu.co/Escuela-de-Ciencias-Humanas/inicio/) at Universidad del Rosario (Bogotá, Colombia). In the past I had the chance of being a visiting scholar at the Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas of the [Sociedad Argentina de Análisis Filosófico (SADAF)](http://www.sadaf.org.ar/es/).
