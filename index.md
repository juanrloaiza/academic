I am a doctoral candidate at the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/) and the [Institut für Philosophie](https://www.philosophie.hu-berlin.de/) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Recently I also had the chance of being a visiting scholar at the Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas of the [Sociedad Argentina de Análisis Filosófico (SADAF)](http://www.sadaf.org.ar/es/).

My interests lie in the frontier between philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. I recently submitted my doctoral dissertation, where I examine some challenges that scientific theories of emotions face and that threaten the elimination of emotions from our scientific vocabulary. I argue that in order to meet these challenges, we must take a step back and examine our folk emotional vocabulary in order to 'reconstitute' the phenomena, and then make clear on what grounds can a scientific theory of emotions construct projectible categories that capture emotion kinds. I conclude by recommending that emotion theorists rely on functional characterizations to formulate theories that can overcome the challenges other theories have faced while maintaining the unity of emotion concepts.

In the past I have been a research assistant at the [Escuela de Ciencias Humanas](http://www.urosario.edu.co/Escuela-de-Ciencias-Humanas/inicio/) at Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia. There I did work on the history and philosophy of science, specifically on the history of theories of visual perception.

Besides my dissertation, I am a founding member of the [Minorities and Philosophy Berlin chapter](http://map-berlin.org/).
