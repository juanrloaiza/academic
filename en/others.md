Besides my academic work in philosophy, I sometimes like to code and engage in small projects. You can find some of these projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/juanrloaiza). Here's some that I would mention:


#### Personal website
This site's code is available on GitHub! You can find it in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/academic/). This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

#### Mining the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
I've been visiting the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to do some text analyses. Some of these you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/SEP_TextMining). Any help or suggestions are more than welcome!

#### Philosophy Journals in Spanish
I also compiled a list of philosophy journals publishing in Spanish. You can find this list [here](https://juanrloaiza.github.io/revistas_filosofia/). Even though it is a very simple site, you can also see how it's coded in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/revistas_filosofia).
