Besides my academic work in philosophy, I sometimes like to code and engage in small projects. You can find some of these projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/juanrloaiza). Here's some that I would mention:

### Text Mining Projects

#### History of philosophy in Latin America
Recently I started a project in collaboration with [Miguel González Duque](https://www.miguelgondu.com) (ITU Copenhagen) to apply text mining methods to three Latin American philosophy journals: [Ideas y Valores](https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/) (Colombia), [Crítica](http://critica.filosoficas.unam.mx/index.php/critica) (Mexico) and [Análisis Filosófico](https://analisisfilosofico.org/index.php/af) (Argentina). The aim is to get some insight on the development of philosophy in Latin America in the last decades using topic modeling. You can find out about our progress in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/latinamerican-philosophy-mining).

#### Mining the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

I've been visiting the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to do some text analyses. Some of these you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/SEP_TextMining). Any help or suggestions are more than welcome!

#### Analyzing my dissertation

As a practice exercise I ran some text mining analyses on my dissertation _Emotions as functional kinds: a meta-theoretical approach to constructing scientific theories of emotions_ (HU Berlin). You can find them in [this repository](https://github.com/juanrloaiza/dissertation-analyses).
