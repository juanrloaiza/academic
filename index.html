  <p class="lead">Philosopher - Doctoral candidate at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain.</p>

  <p>I am a doctoral candidate at the <a href="http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/">Berlin School of Mind and Brain</a> and the <a href="https://www.philosophie.hu-berlin.de">Institut für Philosophie</a> at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. At the moment I am also a visiting scholar at the Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas of the <a href="http://www.sadaf.org.ar/es/">Sociedad Argentina de Análisis Filosófico (SADAF)</a>.</p>

  <p>My interests lie in the frontier between philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. I am currently writing my doctoral dissertation, where I examine some challenges that scientific theories of emotions face and that threaten the elimination of emotions from our scientific vocabulary. I argue that in order to meet these challenges, we must employ a two-step strategy. First, we must take a step back and examine our folk emotional vocabulary in order to 'reconstitute' the phenomena. Second, we must make clear on what grounds a scientific theory of emotions can construct projectible categories that capture emotion kinds. I conclude by recommending that emotion theorists rely on functional characterizations in order to account for variability and other demands. </p>

  <p>In the past I have been a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.urosario.edu.co/Escuela-de-Ciencias-Humanas/inicio/">Escuela de Ciencias Humanas</a> at Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia. There I did work on the history and philosophy of science, specifically on the history of theories of visual perception. </p>
  <p> Besides my dissertation, I am a founding member of the <a href="http://map-berlin.org/"> Minorities and Philosophy Berlin chapter</a>.
