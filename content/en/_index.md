I'm a philosopher interested in interdisciplinary approaches to emotions, particularly in the frontier between philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.

In 2020 I received my PhD from the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/) and the [Institut für Philosophie](https://www.philosophie.hu-berlin.de/) at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. I also hold a master's degree in mind and brain studies from the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/) (2016).

I have published papers in international journals such as [Review of Philosophy and Psychology (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13164-020-00492-8) and [The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science (en prensa)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/715207), as well as in Latin American journals such as [Ideas y Valores (2022)](https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/article/view/103859) and [Perspectiva Filosófica (2022)](https://periodicos.ufpe.br/revistas/perspectivafilosofica/article/view/256754/42986).

Besides my research, I was a co-founding member of the Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) Berlin Chapter, I am a member of the [Sociedad Colombiana de Filosofía (SCF)](https://www.socolfil.org/), and a member and communications coordinator of the [Asociación Latinoamericana de Filosofía Analítica (ALFAn)](http://alfa-n.org/en/).

I recently joined the [philosophy department](https://filosofiahumanidades.uahurtado.cl/departamentos/filosofia/) at the [Universidad Alberto Hurtado](https://www.uahurtado.cl/) (Santiago, Chile) as a full-time tenure-track professor.
